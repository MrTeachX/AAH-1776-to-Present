    <title>African American History Curriculum: 90-Day Semester Plan</title>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals with Era-Specific Accents for navigation, subtle blues for headers. -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a single-page interactive guide. A prominent top navigation bar allows users to select a specific "Unit" (1-5). Upon selecting a unit, a sidebar dynamically populates with a list of all 18 "Days" within that unit. The main content area then displays the selected day's full lesson plan, including Bell Ringer, Essential Questions, Lecture/Discussion points, Student Activity, and Exit Activity. This structure prioritizes clear hierarchical navigation (Unit -> Day) and detailed content display, allowing teachers to easily access and understand individual lessons or the overall flow of each unit. This design was chosen over a linear scroll to make a dense amount of information digestible and quickly accessible. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Content is primarily textual, structured using semantic HTML and styled with Tailwind CSS for readability and hierarchy. Interactive elements are limited to navigation (buttons for units and days) driven by JavaScript to dynamically update content. No charts or complex visualizations are present as the core content is the curriculum plan itself, and the goal is ease of access and readability for daily lesson details. This aligns with the "NO SVG/Mermaid" constraint and focuses on functional UI. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                    This comprehensive semester-long course offers an in-depth and inspiring exploration of African American history from the late 18th century to the present day. We will embark on a journey that begins with the resilience and fierce resistance of enslaved African Americans, who, despite unimaginable adversity, forged communities, preserved rich cultural traditions, and continuously fought for their freedom. The course then navigates the complex landscape of Reconstruction, examining the monumental strides made towards citizenship and equality, alongside the devastating rise of Jim Crow segregation and the determined efforts to dismantle it. We will trace the transformative impact of the Great Migration, which saw millions of African Americans redefine their lives and reshape urban landscapes, leading to the cultural explosion of the Harlem Renaissanceâ€”a period of unparalleled artistic and intellectual brilliance that redefined American identity. The curriculum culminates in a deep dive into the strategic brilliance and heroic actions of the Civil Rights Movement, celebrating its landmark legislative achievements and the diverse philosophies that propelled the fight for liberation. Finally, we will examine the ongoing journey from the Post-Civil Rights Era to today, recognizing continued progress in political representation and cultural influence, while acknowledging the persistent struggles for justice and the emergence of contemporary movements shaping our present and future. Through daily lessons, rigorous primary source analysis, multimedia resources, and interactive assessments, this course emphasizes themes of unwavering resilience, profound creativity, powerful agency, and the enduring pursuit of true equity, fostering critical thinking and empathy as students connect historical triumphs and challenges to contemporary issues.

Detail how this fueled the domestic slave trade, forcing millions westward, and solidifying the South's economic dependence on enslaved labor. Crucial Point: Emphasize that the gin made cotton profitable on an unprecedented scale, rather than reducing the need for labor, it increased it by making more land viable for cotton cultivation. Discuss the explosion of cotton production in the South, particularly the 'Deep South' (Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, etc.). Explain cotton's role as the dominant cash crop, driving the entire Southern economy and a significant portion of the U.S. economy (exports). Connect this to Britain's industrial revolution and its demand for raw cotton. Explain that as new lands opened for cotton, and older tobacco-producing areas in the Upper South became less profitable, there was a massive demand for enslaved labor in the Deep South. Describe the forced migration of enslaved people: estimated over 1 million people were sold from the Upper South (e.g., Virginia, Maryland) to the Deep South. Discuss the devastating human cost: forced family separations, brutal forced marches (Coffles). Reiterate that slavery was not just a social system but a massive economic engine, creating immense wealth for enslavers and contributing significantly to the national economy through the production and export of cotton.",
